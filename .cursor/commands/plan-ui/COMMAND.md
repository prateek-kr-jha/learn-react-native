Plan the UI for this feature using available design assets.

1. **Find design assets** – Look for UI.png, mockups, wireframes, or screenshots in the project (e.g. project root, react-native/, src/media/, docs/)
2. **Analyze the design** – Extract screens, components, layout, and interaction flow from the image(s)
3. **Output a UI plan**:
   - **Screens** – List each screen with main elements
   - **Components** – Reusable UI pieces (buttons, cards, lists, headers)
   - **Component tree** – How components nest per screen
   - **Navigation** – Screen flow and route params
   - **Layout notes** – Flex, spacing, responsive considerations for React Native
   - **Assets** – Icons, images to add or reference

Use `react-native/RN_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for constraints (functional components, FlatList for lists, no complex animations unless justified).

If no design file exists, ask the user to provide one or describe the UI in text.
