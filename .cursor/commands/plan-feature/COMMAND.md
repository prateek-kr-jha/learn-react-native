Plan a new feature using `react-native/RN_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` as context.

Output:
1. **User stories** – What the user can do
2. **src/ structure** – New or modified directories/files (api/, screens/, components/, hooks/, storage/)
3. **API & storage** – Endpoints, AsyncStorage keys, data shapes
4. **Navigation** – New screens, route params
5. **Risks & constraints** – What to avoid, edge cases

Follow separation of concerns. Prefer incremental phases over big-bang delivery.
