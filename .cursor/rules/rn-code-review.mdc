# React Native Code Review

Use when reviewing code. Reference: `react-native/RN_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`

## Checklist
- [ ] Separation of concerns: no API logic in UI components
- [ ] API calls in `api/`; storage in `storage/`
- [ ] Tight coupling or unclear logic ownership flagged
- [ ] Error handling: API failures, loading, empty states
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets; env config safe
- [ ] Prefer clear explanations; no unnecessary rewrites

## Output Format
- **Critical** (must fix)
- **Warnings** (should fix)
- **Suggestions** (consider)
