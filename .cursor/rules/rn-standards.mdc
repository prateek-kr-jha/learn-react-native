# React Native Standards

Reference: `react-native/RN_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`

## Technology Stack
- React Native CLI (no Expo), JavaScript (not TypeScript)
- Functional components, React Hooks
- React Navigation, Axios, AsyncStorage

## Structure
- UI components: no API logic
- API calls: dedicated `api/` layer
- Storage: abstracted in `storage/`
- Navigation: centralized in `navigation/`

## State & Hooks
- Prefer local state first; lift only when needed
- Hooks must follow rules of hooks; side effects explicit; cleanup where applicable
- Use FlatList for lists; avoid inline functions/styles when harmful

## Error Handling
- API failures: graceful handling
- Loading, empty, permission-denied states
- No unexplained crashes

## Principle
Prefer boring, readable, production-safe code over clever abstractions.
